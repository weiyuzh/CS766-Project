# Motivation
Cell detection and counting is fundamental in biomedical and cancer research and it is regarded as the basis of image-based cellular research. So up until recently, a lot of research depended on manually hand-counting the cells you see in an image. And with recent advances in technology and higher image processing capabilities, a lot of methods and softwares have been developed to automating this process. 

However, a great number of them still show limitations when it comes to analyzing a cluster of cells that are in close proximity and especially in 3D culture environments. So the main motivation behind our project was to come up with a method to an accurate measure of the number of cells in volumes and especially in clusters.
